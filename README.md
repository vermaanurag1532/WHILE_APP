While is a new age education-based social media platform that provides an educational environment to youth so that they can grow without any distractions.

While was founded to revolutionize the way of learning among youth by giving them all the essential services they require for free. We aim to eradicate social problems like mental health issues and hidden unemployment among students, which are usually ignored and not talked about.
