3. Open a terminal and run the following git command:
      ```
      git clone "url you just copied"
      ```
   where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.
   For example:
      ```

      ```
      git push -u origin your-branch-name
